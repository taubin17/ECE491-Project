    # Project pseudocode
    # First we check if some things exist, such as: our data, our model

    # If both are present, we can at least train test split.

    # Assuming we have a train/test split done, and a model trained, we can now begin to validate on new data

    # We can do this by adding to our dataframe the latest data. To visualize our models predictions, we can
    # get the current datetime to differentiate what values are known and what values are "foresight"
